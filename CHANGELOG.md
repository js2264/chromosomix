# Changelog

Notable changes to the viewer, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) — for an application that means the **format and URL
contract** rather than a code API: a major bump is a `.metacool` the previous version could open and
this one cannot, or a `#`-hash link that no longer resolves to the same view.

The deployed site at <https://js2264.github.io/metacooler.js/> is built from `main` on every push, so
it can be ahead of the newest entry here. Its exact build is in **About → version**, and in the
`/Producer` field of any PDF it exports.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Picking the newest build did nothing, on the one page where it mattered.**
  Reported from the deployed site: the menu showed `0.6.0` selected with
  `0.6.1` marked *latest*, and choosing `0.6.1` reloaded quickly and changed
  nothing at all.

  Every part of that was working as built. A visitor at the site root is served
  by their service worker, whose cache was a build old — which is the design,
  since an update installs and *waits* for consent rather than swapping code
  under a half-read file. The picker sent them to the site root. The worker
  answered that navigation from the same cache. Nothing in the round trip ever
  asked the network for anything, so it would have done that for ever.

  The newest build is now **taken** rather than navigated to: check for an
  update now, take what is waiting by the same `skip-waiting` handshake the
  update bar uses, and only if the shell is known stale and nothing is waiting,
  drop the worker and reload. The first path replaces the cache rather than
  dropping it, and so keeps offline.

  The state is no longer silent either. When the running build is not the one
  the root publishes, the dialog now says which build is on screen, which one
  the site has, and that an ordinary reload will not fetch it — the absence of
  that sentence is what made this hard to read from the outside.

  This cannot rescue a page that is *already* stuck, since that page is running
  the code without the fix. The update bar is the way out of one, as it always
  was.

- **A drawn pixel no longer straddles two sequences.** A metagenome view was
  reducing the same picture three times over, and two of the three did not know
  where the contigs were: the read summed bins into contig-snapped cells, the
  renderer then pooled *those* into raster pixels flat and two at a time, and the
  browser filtered the result down to the screen. On a 4,882-contig genome each
  drawn pixel therefore held two different contigs and was coloured by the
  brighter of their two diagonals, so pairs of sequences that never touched were
  drawn as one solid block on the diagonal — with the boundary hairline running
  through the middle of it, because the separators were the one layer still drawn
  at the true positions.

  There is now one rule and one place that keeps it: a cell is a run of bins
  inside one sequence, or a run of *whole* sequences, never part of one plus
  something else. `partitionAxis` builds every grid in the app against a cap it
  never exceeds, so the grid the reader builds is the grid the renderer draws and
  nothing pools a second time. `POOLED_CELL_LIMIT` — the 1,024 cells of slack
  that guaranteed the second pooling for any axis between 4,096 and 5,120 cells —
  is gone, and so is `flatBinPooling`, which above 5,120 contigs was mixing whole
  sequences together *in the data* rather than only in the picture.

- **Where sequences outnumber pixels, cells hold whole sequences and say so.** An
  axis of 4,882 contigs cannot give each one a cell in a 4,096-pixel picture, and
  the old answer was to pretend otherwise. Now such a cell is a named set of whole
  sequences, summed, kept inside one genome — the rule the metagenome overview
  already applied to its slots, for the same reason and for the further one that a
  cell belonging to exactly one genome is a cell that can be clicked through. The
  summary states it in the unit the cells actually are: `2 contigs per cell,
  summed`, rather than a base-pair width that no longer means anything.

- **The genome view plans its grid instead of asking for whatever fits.** It sent
  no resolution at all, so a genome of thousands of contigs arrived as a dense
  block that the renderer coarsened on arrival — the path the report above came
  through — and a mammalian chromosome at 10 kb was refused outright for being
  larger than one typed array. The reader now plans any block that begins on a
  contig boundary and reports the plan it used, which is where the view reads its
  resolution from. A region starting mid-contig is left alone: its coordinate
  origin has no cell in a coarse grid, and moving it silently is worse than
  refusing by size.

### Changed

- **The line under a map says two things and stops.** How large the picture is
  and what one cell of it is worth — `4,046 × 4,046 bins · **effective
  resolution: 3.0 kb**` — from one function all four views share, so they cannot
  drift apart on the same fact. Gone from it: `matched chromosome XV ·` and
  `XV × XV ·`, which the title above already says; `bins 28,911–34,679` and
  `contacts between the two regions`, which nobody reads; and `· balanced`,
  which is the colourbar's to say, in the units it is drawn in, beside the
  numbers it applies to.

  The count is the **cells**, and they are called bins, because a cell of the
  picture *is* a bin of the effective resolution: `4,046 × 4,046` at `3.0 kb`
  multiplies out to the 12.1 Mb on screen. Counting the file's own bins would
  put `5,769 bins` beside `200 bp` for a 577 kb chromosome — two numbers on one
  line describing something twice its size. Above one sequence per cell there is
  no bin to speak of, and they are cells again.

- **A cell is a capacity of bins, not a count of sequences.** The first version
  of this had two rules, and the second was wrong: past the point where an
  assembly's sequences outnumbered the cells, *every* cell took a fixed number of
  whole sequences — so a contig of four bins was crushed into half a cell beside
  a contig of one, while the picture had room to draw all four. One rule now: a
  cell holds at most `k` bins and never part of one sequence beside anything
  else. A sequence longer than `k` keeps cells of its own, cut at its own start;
  only the ones too small to fill a cell share. On a 6,174-contig genome at 10 kb
  that is 3,100 cells of 20 kb, with the four-bin contig drawn as two cells and
  the one-bin contigs two to a cell — where before it was one cell for both, and
  the four-bin contig had lost its inside.

- **A group is one sequence, however many cells it spans.** The first cut of the
  membership list walked a group's cells and named the sequence in each, so a
  contig longer than the capacity — which has several cells of its own — was
  listed once per cell: its name appeared twice in the sequence list, its cell
  described itself as holding two sequences, and the bin count was suppressed
  because the cell looked shared. Members are the *distinct* sequences now.

- **The sequence list counts a sequence's own bins.** It was showing
  `end - start`, which counts the **cells** a sequence is drawn in — so a contig
  of two bins read "1 bins" the moment the capacity reached two. It comes from
  the sequence's own length now, which is the number that does not move when the
  picture is coarsened.

- **A shared cell says what is in it.** It used to be labelled with the first
  sequence and nothing else, so the readout named one of two and gave it a
  coordinate inside a cell that is not only its (`Contig_184898`, `0 bp × 0 bp`),
  and the sequence list beside the map listed one contig in two. The readout now
  names them — `Contig_184898 + Contig_321167` — and the list is built from what
  the cells *hold* rather than from what they are labelled with, so every
  sequence is there and every one of them opens.

- **The metagenome's own views join the rest.** Three of them were reducing a
  second time behind the reader:

  - the **whole-metagenome overview** capped its axis at 16,384 units where the
    renderer draws 4,096, so the last two steps were taken flat and blind to the
    genome boundaries `poolUnits` had just snapped to — sixteen genome pairs to a
    pixel, the pointer resolving one of them. The cap is the raster's width now.
    It was a *memory* bound, and memory was never what binds a picture four
    thousand pixels wide;
  - the **contig-level roll-up** had no bound at all: one cell per contig, so a
    genome of 4,882 contigs was a 190 MB accumulator for a 4,096-pixel picture,
    pooled two contigs to a pixel on arrival. It is coarsened where it is built
    now, by the same partition the bin grid uses, inside one genome;
  - the **genome-pair view** stated no resolution at all, and can be pooled like
    any other block.

  All four metacool views — genomes, genome, genome pair, region — and the
  overview now draw the same line, from the same function.

### Known

- **A pooled balanced block is an approximation, and now says nothing about it.**
  Summing balanced values is not balancing at a coarser resolution — the marginals
  of a `k`-bin cell are `k` times a fine bin's, which is why `cooler zoomify
  --balance` re-balances every level from raw counts rather than summing the level
  below. A second cost is quieter: a filtered bin carries a `NaN` weight, the
  dense read multiplies it through so the whole row draws transparent (§6.4, "a
  blank row is an unbalanced row"), and a pooled read drops `NaN` contributions
  instead, so that row returns as an ordinary number. The whole-file view has done
  this since pooling was added; the views above now do it too, because the
  alternative — keeping balanced blocks dense — refuses a mammalian chromosome
  outright and draws everything else through a contig-blind raster. Balancing at
  the read's own resolution, and taking a coarser rung of a laddered `.mcool`
  where one exists, are the real answers and are not attempted here.

- **A coarse cell belongs to the sequence, not to the question.** The grid falls
  at `contigStart + m·k` whatever range was asked for, and a request is widened to
  those edges rather than starting its own grid at its own left edge. So a base
  pair lands in the same cell, holding the same sum, in every view of it, and a
  region of a chromosome now behaves exactly as the chromosome does: one
  coordinate under one pixel, showing the sum beneath it. It also gives the first
  cell a place in the contig's own coordinates — a block opening 320 kb in used to
  call its first cell 0 bp — which is what let the restriction go that kept
  mid-contig regions on the dense path. At most `k − 1` bins are added at each
  end, and the range reported is the range drawn.

- **The reader plans the grid exactly rather than from a bound.**
  `poolPlan`'s `n / (cap − contigs)` is what a *caller* needs, having to name a
  resolution before anything is read. The reader has the contig extents in hand,
  so it searches for the smallest grid that fits — which at a bin count just over
  a multiple of the cap is a whole step finer than the bound allows.

- **Selections larger than the picture are drawn rather than refused.** "This
  selection is 6,000 cells per axis … Select fewer sequences" is a strange thing
  to say to someone who has just ticked *select all*. The axis is named sequences
  either way; only how many share a cell was ever in question, and that is a
  number the summary can state.

- **The summary counts the assembly, not the pooling.** An axis run is one cell's
  name, so counting runs counts cells — and a 4,882-contig genome was reported as
  "across 2,441 contigs" the moment its cells held two apiece.

- **Filtering is decided in the pixels it happens in.** `imageSmoothingEnabled`
  was tested in CSS pixels while the image was placed in device pixels, so on a
  2x display everything between one and two raster pixels per device pixel was
  *magnified* through a bilinear filter — the one combination with nothing to
  recommend it. The same slip applied to every export, where the DPI scale takes
  the place of the device ratio, so a 300 dpi figure was asked the screen's
  question.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **A dropdown that runs another commit.** The site is built from `main` on
  every push and has only ever served the newest of those builds, which is fine
  until a figure comes out different from one made last month. Every deploy now
  also publishes a copy of itself at `…/v/<commit>/`, keeps the recent ones
  beside it, and lists them in `versions.json`; **About → version** offers them
  as a menu directly under the build stamp it continues.

  Picking one is a navigation and not a swap — the two builds are different
  documents, and pretending otherwise would mean shipping a loader whose job is
  to run code from another commit. What travels is what is written down: the
  query string, the hash and the `sessionStorage` tab strip, so a link and a
  view survive the move. A file opened from local disk does not, for the reason
  it does not survive a reload either, and the hint says so rather than letting
  it be discovered. An archived build says what it is in a corner bar, with one
  button back to the newest.

  What is kept is the **last 20 pushes** — the debugging window; past fifty the
  answer is a bisect rather than a menu — and **every tagged commit, for ever**,
  which is the archive proper and the reason to cut a release even though every
  push is already live. A released number is something people cite in a methods
  section, and one that answers 404 two months later is worse than never having
  offered it.

  A release also gets a **permanent address of its own**, `…/v/v0.5.1/`, which
  is a one-kilobyte redirect to the commit rather than a second copy of it. That
  is the URL worth writing down: a commit URL is equally permanent and says
  nothing to a reader. It carries the query and the hash across, so a citation
  can name a *view* of a release and not only the build, and the About dialog
  offers it whenever the build in front of you is one. Tags are read with
  `git ls-remote --tags` — asking the server for its ref names costs a few
  kilobytes, where fetching tags into a depth-1 checkout would drag down an
  object per tag in a repository carrying 250 MB of demo data.

  Kept alongside that is **the oldest build of each `package.json` version**,
  which is the same rule for a release whose tag was pushed after its commit.
  The *oldest* is deliberate and the obvious alternative is wrong: `npm version`
  bumps the version and tags that commit, so every push until the next bump
  reports the same number — keeping the newest would keep a build that calls
  itself `0.6.0`, is labelled `0.6.0` in the menu, and is not `v0.6.0`. That is
  worse than keeping nothing, because it is wrong rather than absent.

  An archived copy leaves out the demo data, the source maps, the manifest and
  the service worker (`vite.pinned.config.ts`), which is ~5 MB against a build's
  19 MB and is what makes keeping twenty affordable inside a 1 GB Pages site.
  Deliberately **not** installable: a dock icon must not open a version
  somebody pinned once to check a figure. None of it exists in the desktop
  build, where an installer is versioned by being an installer.

  Each of those four properties is asserted after the build rather than trusted
  (`scripts/check-pinned-build.mjs`), because each fails quietly and *late*: an
  archived build is the artifact nobody opens for months, so a wrong base is a
  blank page found in November, and a `publicDir` left on exhausts the site's
  budget several deploys after the change that caused it.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Tabs, and a real session behind each one.** Several files open at once, each
  with its own reader worker, its own annotation worker, its own stores and its
  own DOM. Switching a tab in re-parents that DOM rather than rebuilding it, so
  a map comes back with its pixels, its zoom and its scroll exactly as they
  were and without a single byte re-read — which is what a tab has to be for it
  to be worth having over a second browser window.

  The address bar names **the active tab and nothing else**, which is what was
  asked for and also the only coherent answer: a hash is one view state, and
  writing several would make every link a description of somebody else's
  workspace and make the back button walk a history that interleaves three
  files. The rest of the strip lives in `sessionStorage` beside the annotations
  (§8.6), and a restored tab is *named* rather than opened — the label and the
  view state come back, the worker does not, and clicking is what reads the
  file. Eight remembered tabs therefore cost eight labels. One that named a
  local file comes back to the picker with the explanation a pasted local-file
  link has always given, because no browser re-reads a dropped file without a
  gesture.

  Two tabs on one file now share nothing: the per-session memory is keyed on the
  session as well as the URI, so the second view starts with no tracks, no
  filters and no marks rather than adopting the first one's.

- **A second cooler in the lower-left triangle.** A contact matrix is symmetric,
  so half of every square on screen is a mirror of the other half and carries no
  information at all. That is the room this uses: the second file fills it, the
  picture stops being symmetric, and a broken symmetry is read far faster than
  two maps side by side.

  The split is the **matrix** diagonal, not the viewport's, which is what makes
  panning off the diagonal need no rule of its own — the far corner of a trans
  block is entirely above the line and shows the first file alone, and its
  transpose shows the second. Zoom, selection and every other gesture are
  untouched, because the merge happens once per read and hands the renderer an
  ordinary block.

  Dropped on a card in the Annotations column, where everything else that is
  laid over a map already lives. Refused *by name*: a metacool (§8.5's argument,
  applied to a whole matrix), a different bin size (one grid cannot be two
  resolutions), or a chromosome list differing in count, order, spelling or
  length (every coordinate is an index into one such list). An `.mcool` dropped
  at its root opens its finest resolution, as it does on the picker.

  GENERAL becomes File 1 and File 2, each with the mark of its own triangle and
  a close button: closing the second returns to one map, closing the first
  promotes the second, so either is reversible and what remains is an ordinary
  one-file map. `uri2` is in the hash, so a comparison is a link.

  One scale by default, because the same colour meaning the same count is the
  stronger claim. **Match depth** scales the second file so its 99th percentile
  meets the first's — the same order statistic §7.1 picks `vmax` with — for the
  case that motivates it: two libraries of different depth, where the shallower
  is otherwise a pale triangle telling you only that it was sequenced less. Two
  colourbars then read the same colours in each file's own counts, and the
  tooltip and the status line carry both numbers at every cell.

- **A genome browser that needs no contact map.** Until now a bigWig could only
  be looked at beside a cooler of the same assembly, and that was never a
  property of the tracks — it was a property of the coordinate model, which
  started from a matrix and had no way to describe a genome that was not one.

  So there is a second starting point. A `chrom.sizes`, a bigWig, a bigBed or a
  feature file declares the assembly — outright in the first three cases, and as
  a lower bound in the fourth, which is marked as inferred wherever the genome
  is described — and the axis becomes the whole genome laid end to end at one
  unit per base pair. Everything drawn on it is drawn by the code that draws the
  lanes beside a heatmap, through the same `LocusAxis` §8.4 already made the
  only one: a track cannot be at two positions because only one thing knows
  where a base pair is.

  The gestures are the map's, deliberately. A drag pans, Option-drag selects a
  range to zoom into, the wheel zooms about the pointer, a double click fits, a
  lane's border resizes it and its body reorders the stack — every one of them
  the gesture that already meant that. The one that is the browser's own is
  ⌘-scroll over a lane, which moves *that* track's ceiling from whatever it is
  currently resolved to; it is the adjustment a genome browser is asked for
  constantly and a map has no analogue for it.

  With it: a locus box that accepts `chrI:1,000-20,000`, a bare sequence name or
  `*`, and shows back exactly what it would accept; a feature search over every
  loaded gene model and peak set; click a gene to zoom to it and a sequence name
  to go there; a ruler that draws sequence bands zoomed out and base pairs
  zoomed in, because at those two extremes they are different questions; arcs
  for a BEDPE, which is what a loop call looks like in one dimension; range and
  group editors on each lane, revealed by pointing at it; autoscale groups that
  stack or share a single lane; and PDF/PNG export redrawn at the export scale.

  The two shapes of browser are one session. Drop a `.cool` anywhere on the
  tracks and the tab becomes its map, tracks and all; close the map from the
  File card and it falls back to a browser on the cooler's own `/chroms`, with
  the same tracks still loaded. A file whose name says nothing is opened as a
  map and, if that fails, identified by its bytes and re-routed rather than
  reported as broken.

- **bigBed is read.** Whole, and parsed as the BED it holds, so a bigBed12 draws
  its exons exactly as the text file would — one parser, one set of rules, one
  place where BED's quirks live. Not windowed, because a `FeatureSet` lives on
  the main thread precisely so that a pan redraws with no round trip (§8.4). A
  file past a million intervals is cut off and says so.

- **The 1D browser exports a vector PDF**, and it is the drawing rather than a
  photograph of it. Nothing in that view is a raster — every mark is a
  rectangle, a polyline or a word — so a 300 dpi image of it is a figure nobody
  can restyle, recolour or scale, in a file fifty times the size of the drawing
  it contains. The page is produced by handing the *same* renderers a context
  that emits PDF operators instead of pixels, so there is no second drawing of
  the view to keep in step: `render/features.ts`, `render/tracks.ts`,
  `render/lane.ts` and `render/browser.ts` do not know which one they are
  talking to. Text is Helvetica, one of the fourteen fonts every reader has, so
  nothing is embedded; the halo behind each track name survives as PDF's own
  stroked text mode; and the content stream is deflated, which on a whole-genome
  gene model is the difference between a twelve-megabyte figure and a
  seven-hundred-kilobyte one. A vector page has no resolution, so the DPI
  control is disabled while it is chosen rather than quietly ignored. The
  heatmap's PDF is unchanged and stays a raster, because a contact map *is* one.

- **The tracks answer to a hand, and the panel answers to a list.** Rows
  reorder by their grip or by the arrow keys, and a lane reorders by dragging
  its body; a tick box on each row opens a batch bar that puts several tracks in
  one autoscale group, gives them one colour, one height, or removes them
  together — six tracks from one experiment were six trips through six rows. A
  colour swatch sits beside each name and *is* the colour input, so changing a
  track's colour is one click rather than a menu. Every track's name is larger
  and its controls smaller: colour, limits, a ceiling slider and its group, laid
  out under the name where a reader is already looking, revealed by pointing at
  the lane and drawn over the top of it rather than across its data.

- **A drag on the ruler zooms, with no modifier.** The coordinate strip is where
  a reader points to say "this much", and it is the one gesture whose meaning
  its position already settles — so spending a keystroke on it bought nothing.
  Option-drag still selects on the tracks themselves, where a drag means pan.

- **Fit every track into the space there is**, in the proportions they are
  already in rather than equally: a reader who gave the gene model three times
  the height of a coverage track meant it, and "fit" is a request about the
  stack running off the bottom of the window. Equal heights is the other thing,
  and the Groups card still offers it per group.

- **A file dropped anywhere in the middle of the window is imported.** The drop
  zones in the Annotations column say what each kind of file becomes and are
  still there, but a reader with a bigWig in hand and a browser on screen means
  one thing by dropping it, and asking them to find the right box first is a
  step that answers a question nobody had.

- **Gene names sit under the features**, in a band of their own, so a name never
  covers the exon structure it belongs to; below the height where that band
  would leave no room for a glyph they go back inside, which is what a lane
  dragged very short should do.

- **Aesthetics can turn every word off.** One toggle hides track names, value
  ranges and feature names together, leaving the ink — which is what a figure
  destined for a caption usually wants, and what a screenshot of six tracks
  usually does not. Shared with the heatmap's own panel and the command palette,
  so all three agree.

- **Chromosome boundaries are drawn**, as a full-height rule between sequences,
  and the ruler bands alternate by the sequence's position in the assembly
  rather than by its position on screen — so a boundary does not change shade
  when a pan brings a new sequence into view.

- **The tabs are shaped like tabs**, with tilted sides, the active one raised
  and lit along its top edge, and the pointer is the same black-filled arrowhead
  over the tracks that it is over the map. The × appears on the tab under the
  pointer and on no other — including the active one, which used to be an
  exception — and it lost the bordered box that was most of what the corner of a
  tab showed. One session is a title rather than a tab: the strip stays, because
  the way to a second session is the button on it, but a lone trapezoid with an
  accent bar is machinery announcing a choice nobody has been offered.

- **Every sequence in the genome, with its length, under the Genome card.** The
  first question a genome browser is asked, and until now the only answer was a
  count. Each row is a click that goes there, which is also the fastest way to
  navigate — a chromosome *is* a locus, and the locus box is for the case where
  you already know the coordinate. The bar behind each row is its length against
  the longest, which costs a gradient and turns a column of numbers into the
  shape of an assembly: sixteen bars in a staircase is a yeast, one bar with a
  thousand slivers under it is a draft. A filter appears above a dozen
  sequences, and at most three hundred rows are built at once, because forty
  thousand scaffolds is a second of layout for a list nobody scrolled to the end
  of.

- **A track's range is under its name, and you can type in it.** Two changes
  that are one change. A number at the far end of a lane from the name it
  belongs to has to be paired up by eye every time, and with four tracks stacked
  that is four crossings of the window — so it moved under the name. And a
  number that is under its name is a number you can put a caret in: hovering
  either end gives a text cursor, and clicking opens a box exactly where the
  number was drawn, so nothing moves when it becomes editable. Typing a bound
  turns autoscale off, because that is what typing a bound means. The two boxes
  that used to live in the lane's hover row are gone with it — the range is
  edited where it is read now, and what is left there is `auto`, the ceiling
  slider, the colour and the group.

- **A toggle for the shading under a track's line.** The pale envelope that says
  what a zoomed-out mean hid, and the fill an area track carries: one switch,
  because they are one thing to the eye. Both are *context* for the line, and
  context is the first thing to go when three tracks share a lane or a figure is
  going into a caption. Shared with the heatmap's own panel and the command
  palette, like the track-text toggle beside it.

- **The Plot card is marks rather than sentences.** Fit across, fit down, words
  on or off, shading on or off — four things a reader does over and over while
  reading, in a row of four icons instead of a column of full-width buttons
  spelling each of them out. The same two fit marks are on the toolbar above the
  tracks, because they are the same two actions. And the export controls are one
  line again: a vector page has no resolution, so the resolution is *absent*
  exactly when the long format name needs the width.

- **Memory and CPU on the status bar**, after what has been read and whether the
  file checks out. Per *browser tab* rather than per session, because the memory
  a gene model holds and the core a scan is burning are shared by every tab in
  the window.

  Both are weaker than what a task manager shows, and the tooltips say so
  outright. A page cannot see its own process — a precise figure would read
  across origins — so memory is the JavaScript heap and its ceiling where that
  is all Chromium offers, and the whole-agent measurement where a build is
  cross-origin isolated. CPU has no API at all, so it is measured from the
  inside: every thread in the tab times its own event loop, and the share of the
  last three seconds they could not answer in, summed against the machine's
  cores, is the number. Work too brief to delay anything never appears, so the
  reading is a floor rather than an estimate. The workers report their own, which
  is the point — a whole-genome scan pins a worker for minutes while the main
  thread sits idle.

- **Drop a file on the map itself to make it a track**, on the edge you aim at:
  a strip along its bottom for the horizontal stack, one down its side for the
  vertical one. Two rectangles appear while a drag carrying files is over it and
  are inert the rest of the time, because the map's own gestures — pan, the
  Option-drag selection, the click that opens a cell — live in the same pixels.
  What the file *is* is still decided by its bytes (§8.3): a `.cool` aimed at
  the bottom of the map is a map, not a track drawn along the bottom.

- **`/` puts the caret in the box, in every view.** It was the genome browser's
  alone, so the same key that found a gene did nothing the moment a `.cool` was
  dropped in the same tab. Each view now answers it with its own box: the region
  box on a region, the filter above a table, and a new one in the heading of the
  whole-genome, genome, pair and scan views — which is also the only way to
  leave those pictures by typing rather than by aiming, and a genome of one
  metagenome's four thousand is a quarter of a pixel to aim at. The key is
  printed in the box and steps out of the way when the caret arrives.

- **Every shortcut is on the button that performs it.** Tooltips name their key
  — the panel folds, the theme, the tab strip, both Plot cards, every overlay
  toggle, the breadcrumb's landing views — and the two `whole genome →` buttons
  and the breadcrumb menu print theirs as a badge. The bindings come from two
  tables (`ui/commands.ts` and `ui/plotOptions.ts`) that the key handler, the
  palette, the shortcuts dialog and every one of those tooltips now share, and a
  test asserts no two actions claim the same key.

- **A mark before every card title** in the three panels, so a column of five
  cards is recognised by shape before it is read.

- **A height for every track, and the button that gives it to them**, in the
  browser's Plot card beside the stretch mark. Stretching answers "use the space
  I have"; this answers "I know what a track should look like" — ninety pixels
  is where a yeast ATAC track starts showing the shape of a promoter — and it is
  also the way *out* of a stretch, which on a tall screen with two tracks leaves
  two four-hundred-pixel lanes and nothing to bring them down with. The box is a
  number and nothing happens as it is typed; Enter and the button are the
  instruction, so it keeps what you last applied and the next file is one press
  away from it.

- **Drag a track onto the other edge of the map to move it there.** The two
  rectangles that take a dropped file take a *loaded* track as well: pick a row
  up by its grip in the Tracks card, and both rectangles appear the moment it is
  over the map — drop on one and the track is drawn there instead.

  The gesture is on the row rather than on the lane's *body*, and that is the
  second attempt. Dragging the body is what a reader reaches for and there is no
  room for it there: a lane already answers three drags — its border resizes,
  along the axis pans, across reorders — so a fourth had to be read out of one
  of them, and the trip from the bottom stack to the right-hand rectangle is
  mostly sideways, which is a bottom lane's *pan*. It worked from one stack and
  fought the other. The row carries no such freight, and it is where the track's
  other settings are. (The lane got the gesture back in the end, on a handle of
  its own — see below.)

  A row now has a grip beside a map even when it is the only one, since there it
  has something to do besides reorder. The drag carries its own MIME type, so
  the rectangles can tell it from a dropped file and from a dragged word while
  the drag is still in the air, and the whole content area no longer lights up
  for it. It is the same state as the `location` setting on the row, because it
  is the same field.

- **`S` saves the plot.** Whichever view is mounted exports itself — the map or
  the browser — in the format and at the resolution its own Plot card is set to,
  because a shortcut that saved something other than the button beside it would
  be a second export to keep in step. It is one letter from `⌘S`, which saves
  the *session*, and that is the pairing: two things a reader means by "save
  this", told apart by the modifier. Stretching the tracks moves to `H`, for
  height.

- **`location`, in the row's settings, rather than `B`/`R` tick boxes on its
  head.** Two buttons with the words on them — `bottom` and `right`, and not a
  choice between each other, since a track can be on both — drawn as one
  segmented control below `height`. The initials were standing furniture in
  six-point type between a track's name and its eye, for a decision taken once
  per track and now also takeable by dragging the lane itself. The last edge a
  track is on cannot be switched off: a lane on neither edge is drawn nowhere
  while still calling itself visible, and the eye beside the name is what hides
  a track.

- **The drop zone is what lights up**, not the card around it. A card that asks
  for a file still takes one anywhere on it — a reader whose pointer is over the
  eighth row when they let go meant to load it — but what reacts is the dashed
  box, which is the element already drawn as the target. The whole card going
  blue around an inert rectangle said the rectangle was not the one. Tracks,
  Compare and the browser's Contact map card all behave this way now, and a
  *row* dragged within the Tracks card lights nothing, because a drag carrying
  no files is a reorder.

- **Plot before Groups** in the browser's Aesthetics column. Plot acts on this
  picture and is there whatever the file is; Groups is empty until a reader has
  made one, and a column that opens with an empty card reads as a column with
  nothing in it. The browser's toolbar also gives up its autoscale button, which
  was the sixth control in a row that then wrapped, orphaning one button on a
  line of its own — it is in the Plot card, on `Y`, where the height box is.

- **A track lands under the map, not beside it.** The bottom edge is where a
  track is read — under a ruler, left to right — and a coverage profile turned
  on its side has to be read with your head tilted. The right-hand stack is
  still there and is now something you choose: the `B`/`R` boxes on the row, or
  the edge you drop the file on.

- **`S` stretches the tracks** to fill the height, all of them to one height,
  which is the thing a reader reaches for several times a session. Autoscale,
  which had `S`, is now `Y` — the axis it acts on — and works beside a map as
  well as under a browser, since they are the same tracks in the same store.

- **The status bar is one line, always.** It is the bottom edge every view is
  measured against, and it grew a second line exactly when the pointer was over
  a stack of tracks — when the reader is least interested in it. So `read` is
  bytes and keeps the request count in the panel it already opens on hover,
  `memory` is bytes and keeps the share of the ceiling there too, and the
  coordinate readout is the item that gives way, being the one thing here that
  is re-said a moment later.

- **The standing `read in place · nothing is sent` line is gone from the bar.**
  The claim is not: the picker states it where a file is about to be opened, and
  About states it in full. It was a sentence you finish reading once, permanently
  occupying a corner of a bar whose other three items are numbers that change.

- **The shortcuts dialog has no Help group**, so the two gesture tables — what a
  drag, a wheel and a double click do on a map, against what they do on the
  tracks — sit side by side, which is how they are read. `⌘/` was the only bound
  command in Help and is now beside the palette in App, where it belongs. Both
  tables also gained the gestures they had been missing: the lane resize, the
  edge drops, and dropping a file on the browser's tracks.

- **The Compare card and the browser's Contact map card wear the Tracks card's
  load zone** — a thin unshaded box with a bold line and a quiet one, then the
  URL behind a fold. All three ask the reader for a file, and three shaded
  variations of one gesture in one column read as three applications. The
  Contact map card can now take a URL, which it could not before.

- **One box in the browser's toolbar**, not two. `chrIV:1,000-2,000`, `chrIV`
  and `GAL4` are three spellings of "where do I want to be", and asking which of
  two boxes each spelling belonged in was a taxonomy the reader had to learn in
  order to type a word. Coordinates win when the text is coordinates; anything
  else falls to the list of names under the box. Clicking it selects what is
  there, because what is there is where you already are, and `/` still lands in
  it.

- **Loading a track is at the top of the Tracks card**, rather than in a card of
  its own below it. The two questions are asked of the same thing, and with
  eight tracks loaded the way to load a ninth was to scroll past the eight.

- The app was one object holding a worker, a store, a file and a view, and it
  bound itself to the address bar in its constructor. It is now `app/Session.ts`
  — a file and the views of it — and `app/App.ts` — the window around them —
  with `main.ts` as three lines of bootstrap. `ViewStore` stops owning the hash,
  because there is one address bar and there may be six stores.

- The sample cache that keeps pan and zoom free of I/O moved out of
  `AnnotationLanes` into `annotations/samples.ts`. Two widgets need that rule now
  and its arithmetic — the padded window, the power-of-two bucket, keeping the
  old data on screen until the new data lands — is fiddly enough that two copies
  would drift.

- A `chrom.sizes` dropped on a browser whose lengths were *inferred* replaces
  them, and replaces only them: the URI, the session memory and every loaded
  track stay exactly as they were, because the genome did not change — only what
  is known about it. A `samtools faidx` `.fai` counts as one, decided by its
  name, which is the tiebreak `sniffFormat` already uses for the two cases its
  columns cannot settle.

- The colour swatch beside a track's name in the Annotations panel appears when
  the row is pointed at or has the focus, like the drag handle it sits next to.
  A column of coloured squares down the panel is a second legend for something
  the picture already says where it matters — the lane is drawn in that colour,
  and where two share a lane so is each name. It keeps its space while it is
  invisible, so reaching for it is one movement rather than a hunt.

- **Every lane has a grip, in both views.** Six dots beside the track's own
  name — the same glyph the Tracks card puts at the head of every row, because
  it is the same gesture on the same thing. Dragging it moves the track through
  the stack; beside a map, dragging it out onto either rectangle draws the track
  on that edge instead. Reordering a track was something you could only do to
  the picture from the *list* beside it, or by learning that a drag across a
  lane means one thing and along it means another.

  It is a fourth *surface* rather than a fourth reading of one, which is what
  makes it possible at all: a press that starts on the handle is not ambiguous
  in any direction, so it can mean "move this track" everywhere the pointer
  goes, and the three drags the lane's body already answers keep their pixels
  untouched. Drawn on the canvas rather than laid over it, for the reason every
  affordance here is: the pointer is an arrowhead pointing at a base pair, and a
  handle that lived in the cursor would not exist until you were on it. It takes
  the open hand as its cursor — the one thing the arrowhead cannot say — and is
  never on a saved figure, because what a reader points at is not part of the
  picture.

  **It is the only way to move a track.** The lane's body used to reorder as
  well, by reading the direction of the first movement — along the axis a pan,
  across it a reorder. Two meanings for one surface is a rule you have to know
  before your first drag does what you meant, and it was paid for on every pan
  that wandered a few pixels off the horizontal: the track jumped a slot,
  because a gesture that has to be performed *carefully* had been asked for.
  With a surface of its own for moving, the body goes back to meaning one thing.

  It hangs **outside** its lane, in the margin just before the data starts, and
  that is what lets every lane show one at all times. Inside, it had to be paid
  for twice: a slot cut out of the front of each label, which moved every track
  name along, and a glyph that could only appear on hover — because a permanent
  one would have been sitting on the signal. Outside, it costs the picture
  nothing, so the names went back against the start of their own track and the
  handles stopped being something to discover. Each one is on its name's line
  and keeps its distance from it, wherever the layout put that name: at the top
  over the data, centred in a column, down at the floor on a flipped track. The
  faint one is a handle; the solid one is the lane the pointer is on.

  The 1D browser keeps a thirteen-pixel strip at its left for them, since
  outside its first lane is off the edge of the canvas otherwise. Beside a map
  no strip is needed — the plot's own margin is where they go. Which end of a
  lane that is depends on which way the lane reads: the left of a bottom lane,
  and the *bottom* of a right-hand one, which turns a quarter turn and reads
  upward from there. A handle at the far end of a track from its own name is a
  handle belonging to nothing in particular.

  A grip drag raises the **other** edge's rectangle and only that one. A track
  taken out of the bottom stack cannot be moved to the bottom — it is already
  there — so offering it that target is offering a gesture with no outcome, and
  a rectangle that lights under the pointer and then does nothing when you let
  go reads as the drag having failed. The rectangle that is not offered is not a
  drop target either, decided in one place, so what lights up and what lands
  cannot disagree. A file dragged in from the desktop still gets both, since it
  is on neither edge yet.

  The right-hand stack makes its own room. Its handles hang past the end of the
  data, where the space available is whatever the heatmap left under its plot —
  a couple of pixels in a view with no column labels — so rather than back the
  handle into the signal, the stack adds the few pixels it is short to the end
  of its own canvas. After the data, so no coordinate moves and the map is not
  touched, and only when the margin is not already enough.

- **Loop anchors moved off the last track.** The triangle that says "this
  coordinate" was drawn over the last seven pixels of the last lane in the
  stack — on a coverage track that is the busiest part of it, and on a full one
  the mark is invisible. It now has a band of its own past the stack, on both
  edges, which is the only place a glyph about the axis can go without being ink
  on somebody's data. The band is nine pixels and exists only while a loop is
  marked, so a session that never places one keeps those pixels for the map.

- **The map's two drop rectangles moved inside the map, and became strips.**
  They covered the bottom quarter and the right fifth of the whole plot area —
  which is where the lane stacks are — so a track dragged towards the end of its
  own stack met a drop target instead of the gap it was aiming for, and the last
  slot in the order could not be reached at all. Inside the map they overlap
  nothing that can be dragged, and they still name the edge they stand for: the
  bottom of the picture means below it, the right of the picture means beside
  it.

  Narrow, too, and **centred on the edge they name**: thirty pixels thick, four
  fifths of the map long, each in the middle of its own side. A quarter of the
  map's height and a fifth of its width is a lot of a picture to cover in order
  to say "this edge", and at that size the two rectangles hid the corner of the
  matrix a reader is usually aiming past on the way to them. Centring at four
  fifths is also what keeps them apart — each stops a tenth of the map short of
  the corner they share — so a drop in the corner lands on neither, which is the
  honest answer to a gesture aimed between two targets. Down the side the label
  turns the same quarter turn as the track names in the stack it is naming. All three
  gestures that aim at them — a file from the desktop, a row from the Tracks
  card, a lane by its handle — now arm them, and while a lane is being carried
  the tooltip stays down rather than following the pointer across the map with a
  reading from where the drag started.

### Fixed

- **The service worker would have answered a pinned URL with the newest build.**
  It is registered at the site root, so every archived build's address is inside
  its scope, and its navigation handler answered *everything* in scope from the
  precached shell — the right URL, the wrong code, and no symptom to notice it
  by. Navigations under `<scope>v/` now go to the network untouched.

  A worker only updates when a page it controls is loaded, so the fix cannot
  reach a reader who is already carrying an older one — and that reader is
  exactly who follows a pinned link. `recoverPinnedNavigation()` catches the
  case from the page itself: a document built for the site root, at an address
  under the archive prefix, is a pair of facts that cannot both be true of a
  correctly served page. It unregisters and reloads, once per tab, because the
  second attempt at that would be a reload loop.

- **A cooler rendered nothing.** `MatrixPanel`'s new edge-drop watcher read
  `this.el` from the constructor, where it does not exist yet, so the panel threw
  on the way up — for every file that *has* annotations, which is every cooler,
  while a `.metacool` (which has none, §8.5) was unaffected. Clicking a contig or
  opening the whole-genome view produced no map at all. The listeners go on the
  grid instead, which exists by then and is the honest scope anyway: it holds the
  map, its lanes and the two zones, while `this.el` reaches the colourbar and the
  header, where a drag means nothing.

  It survived a type check, 697 unit tests and a code read, because none of them
  run the constructor. What catches this class of defect is opening the app, so
  the working file now gets opened: a genuine `.cool` built by the public cooler
  API, served over range requests, driven through the contigs table, the
  whole-genome view, a region, and a browser session with a track in it.

- **The labels overlay could not be toggled in a genome browser session.** `L`
  was bound twice — the overlay, and "go to a locus" — and the command list is
  searched in order, so in a browser the locus box always won. The browser has
  one box that is both a locus bar and a search field, and it now has one key
  for it (`/`), which is the key every other view answers too.

- The icon generator dropped every SVG attribute whose name contained a digit,
  so every `<line>` was emitted with no coordinates and drew nothing. It had
  been latent because no icon used one; the magnifiers added here came out as
  bare circles.

- A lane's hover controls took presses while they were invisible. `opacity: 0`
  hides a control but does not stop it being clicked, so every track carried a
  band across it — three hundred pixels wide and thirty tall — where a drag
  started on a `<select>` and the view silently refused to pan. They are now
  transparent to the pointer until the lane they belong to is the one being
  pointed at, and the pointer moving onto them no longer counts as leaving the
  view: without that the row goes untouchable, the pointer lands back on the
  canvas, the row is revealed again, and the control under the hand is never
  there long enough to be clicked.

- "Fit tracks to the space" measured the element it was about to resize, which
  is sized by its own contents — so it compared the tracks against themselves,
  found them already fitted, and did nothing at all. It now measures the column
  the view was mounted in, walking past the `display: contents` wrapper that
  gives a session's panels to the shell's grid and reports every rectangle as
  zero.

- Every control that appears on hover — a tab's ×, a track's colour swatch — is
  now inert while it is invisible, and shown outright where there is no pointer
  to hover with (`@media (hover: none)`). Both halves matter: `opacity: 0` hides
  a button and does not stop it taking a click, and a control revealed by
  pointing is a control that appears never on a touch screen. Each appears with
  no transition and fades only on the way out, so there is no moment in which
  one is clickable and barely drawn.

- Moving the caret from one lane's limit straight to another's kept the first
  number. The press that lands on a second limit is handled on `pointerdown` and
  calls `preventDefault`, so it never produces the focus change that would have
  committed the first — and the editor was being *cancelled* on the way out. The
  natural gesture for setting the same bound on two tracks was therefore the one
  gesture that silently threw the first value away, while clicking anywhere else
  on the canvas committed it.

- With the words switched off, the lane's two limit boxes were seeded once and
  never refreshed, and committing either one wrote *both* — so typing a floor
  republished whatever ceiling the row happened to be built with, silently
  undoing a zoom or a drag of the ceiling slider. Each box now commits its own
  bound and takes the other from the axis on screen, exactly as the drawn range
  does, and the untouched box follows the lane it is beside.

- Choosing PNG collapsed the export row: the resolution select inherits
  `width: 100%` from the controls card, and a `flex-basis: auto` resolves to it,
  so a control that must not shrink claimed the whole line — crushing the format
  select to nothing and pushing Save off the card.

- A click in the Sequences card now moves the view directly rather than through
  the view state. A patch that serialises to what is already stored is dropped
  without notifying, so clicking the sequence the hash already named could do
  nothing at all.

- `fmt.int` groups digits in the *viewer's* locale, and half of Europe groups
  them with a space WinAnsi has no byte for — so a figure exported in French
  read `7?071 in view`, every grouped number corrupted by the app's own
  formatter, in the one place nobody would look for a locale bug. Those spaces
  now fold onto the non-breaking space WinAnsi does have.

- Ticking a track did not open the batch bar until the focus left the list. The
  rebuild is deferred while a control in the list is being edited — a colour
  picker closes and a half-typed name is lost otherwise — and a checkbox was
  being counted as one, which deferred the very rebuild the tick was asking
  for. It commits on the click that focuses it, so there is nothing to protect;
  the focus is put back on the same box afterwards, so a second tick needs no
  second aim.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Fixed unit tests that errored on Github runners without fixtures.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Right-click the map to mark the cell under the pointer.** Vertical line,
  horizontal line, crosshair, loop — each row showing the coordinate it would
  use, so what is about to be marked is visible before it is — and copy
  coordinates. The two ways in that existed were typing a coordinate you already
  know and arming a mode and clicking; neither answers "this one, the one I am
  pointing at".

- **Lanes beside the map are draggable, and carry their own menu.** The border
  resizes a track, the body reorders the stack, and dragging *along* the axis
  still pans the map — which it has to, since that is what dragging a track has
  always done. The direction of the first movement tells the three apart, so
  nothing needs a modifier key and no gesture was given up for another. A right
  click on a lane offers its colour, its range, hide and remove: the two
  controls a reader beside the map actually reaches for, where the track is
  rather than across the window in a card.

- **Hand-drawn lines are continued into the lanes.** A vertical rule is a column
  and is drawn under the map; a horizontal one is a row and is drawn beside it;
  a crosshair is both. Loop anchors are small triangles on each stack's outer
  edge, pointing back at the map. A mark called out on the matrix is a
  coordinate, and the tracks beside it are what a coordinate is usually being
  compared against — the marks were on the map alone, which is where the
  comparison could not be made.

- **Tick any number of genomes or sequences and see them as one map.** Each on
  the diagonal and every block between them off it — the picture the pair view
  showed for exactly two, without the two diagonals that make an off-diagonal
  block readable. Both tables carry checkboxes now, with "select all" over
  whatever the filters leave visible (filter to completeness above 90, then take
  all of them) and "clear"; the button names two and counts more, because
  `MAG_7 × MAG_12 →` is worth more than a number and four names are longer than
  a button.

  It is a view state — `view=selection&genomes=a,b,c`, or `regions=` for
  sequences — so a selection is a link, a history entry and a back button, and
  `genomes=a,b` is precisely what `view=pair` used to be. The pair view stays
  where it is: the overview's cross-genome clicks lead there and so do links
  already sent.

  The read is the whole-file scan with most of the file left out. A selection is
  scattered through the pixels, so there is no shorter span to walk — the gate
  says so, and the progress bar and cancel are the ones the whole-genome read
  just gained. The axis is built from the selection in *file* order rather than
  the order it was ticked in, because a matrix whose rows jump about is a
  picture of the clicking; it is pooled against its own size, so four MAGs are
  drawn at four MAGs' resolution however large the file they came from is; and a
  genome resolves to its contigs, so ticking four MAGs and ticking their contigs
  are the same map. Checked on every fixture against the same oracle the pooled
  read uses: a scattered selection equals the dense block rolled up over the
  same grouping, cell for cell.

- **The app says what it is on the way in.** The mark — the same drawing as the
  favicon, the install prompt and the dock icon — is now a masthead on the
  landing page: mark and name on one line, centred, spanning 80% of the drop
  zone below them, with the tagline under and 20 px of air above. Both are
  scaled by one `clamp`ed font size, so the pair stays one thing from a phone to
  a wide window. In the header
  it sits at 26 px before the name, sharing its centre — the brand row was
  baseline-aligned, and an image's baseline is its bottom edge, so the mark hung
  visibly high against the words. The first screen used to open on an
  instruction, which made it a dialog rather than a page. It is read from the
  192 px file `npm run icons:app` already writes, not a fifth copy of the shapes.

- **"whole genome →" in the genomes and chromosomes tables.** The whole-file view
  was reachable from the chevron beside the root crumb and nowhere else, which is
  a corner of the window to find something the table in front of you is the
  question about. The metacool gets its scan, the cooler its map; the button is
  absent on a metacool's per-genome contigs table, where "the whole file" is not
  what is being asked.

- **The cooler's whole-genome read has a progress bar and a cancel**, the same
  two the whole-metagenome scan has always had — it is the same pass over every
  pixel of the same file, and the difference was in the plumbing rather than in
  the wait. What made it possible is the reader walking a span *asynchronously*:
  a cancel arrives as a message, and a synchronous loop never lets the message
  queue run however many microtasks it awaits, so a read that could take twenty
  seconds could not be called off and could not say how far along it was. The
  contig roll-up is watched the same way, since it walks the same pixels.

- **Hand-drawn marks can be saved.** The Manual annotations card grows the export
  row the Aesthetics panel has — a format, and a Save — writing lines as BED and
  loops as BEDPE, one base wide and half-open. Both come back through this app's
  own sniffer and parsers as an overlay on the map, which is the property
  `manual-export.test.ts` checks rather than the text; and both are what bedtools
  reads, because a coordinate someone chose outlives the session they chose it
  in. Nothing to write is a disabled button rather than an empty file.

- **The whole-genome view of a cooler is read at the resolution it is drawn at,
  and there is no longer a file size that defeats it.** It used to ask for one
  cell per file bin, which at 24,228 bins is 2.3 GB of values in one array — and
  a browser serves at most 2 GiB in one, whatever the machine has, so a whole
  yeast genome at 500 bp was offered, computed for several seconds, and then
  refused. The picture it was refused for was one nothing could have shown: the
  renderer pools any raster to 4,096 px per axis, so those 24,228 rows were
  always going to be drawn as about 4,000 pixels.

  So the pooling moved to the read. Every `stride` consecutive bins of a
  chromosome are summed into one cell, in the worker, straight from the stored
  pixels — the block that arrives is the one that was always going to be drawn.
  Yeast at 500 bp is 4,047 cells and 66 MB instead of 24,228 and 2.3 GB; at
  200 bp, where the dense block would have been 14.7 GB, it is the same 66 MB.
  A human cooler at 10 kb, 381.9 GB dense, is 67 MB and 760 kb cells. The read
  is bounded by construction at every bin size a file can have.

  **What arrives is an ordinary block one bin size up**, not a new kind of
  object: the stride restarts at every chromosome, so a cell is `stride` bins of
  one sequence and a run of cells is that sequence. The panel is told the coarser
  bin size and every coordinate, tick, tooltip, region box and figure caption is
  then right without knowing pooling happened — a box drawn on the 3 kb overview
  still opens that region at the file's own 500 bp. It is the relationship an
  `.mcool`'s 5 kb level has to its 1 kb level, computed on the way through rather
  than stored, and the sums are identical to `metacooler aggregate` over the same
  squares (`pooling.test.ts` checks every fixture, cell for cell, against the
  dense read rolled up by the existing folded aggregation).

  What the view still costs is the pass over the stored pixels, which is what it
  always cost, and that is now what it asks about: above ten million pixels the
  map waits behind a button that states how many there are and what resolution
  they will be summed into. Below it nothing is asked. The whole-metagenome scan
  is gated for that same reason, and the two views now behave alike down to the
  wording.

- **Both whole-file views are kept across navigation.** They are the expensive
  reads, so the shell holds whichever one it built, keyed on what was read (uri,
  level, balance): leaving one for a chromosome and coming back returns to the
  picture rather than to the gate. Changing the level or the balance is a
  different read, so that one is rebuilt and the old block released rather than
  left in memory unread.

### Removed

- **Captions on hand-drawn marks.** A text box under every mark, for a sentence
  the figure already makes. Gone from the card, from the model and from the
  drawing — and with it the label helper, the halo it needed and the type size it
  was written at.

### Fixed

- **A right-click on the map no longer navigates.** `mousedown` fires for every
  button, and the map's press/release pair had no guard, so a right-press was
  answered as a click on release: right-clicking a whole-genome view opened
  whatever cell was under the pointer, and the menu the press was for arrived
  over the view it had just left. The primary button only, now — and the same
  guard on the side panels' drag handle, where a right-press armed a resize the
  browser's own menu then sat on top of.

- **Both ends of a loop are marked on both 1D axes.** A loop is a statement
  about two loci, and a reader looking at the tracks under one end of it is
  asking what is at the other. Drawing the row anchor only beside the map and
  the column anchor only under it answered half of that on each edge, and
  neither half where the comparison is made.

- **The masthead's mark sits on the word's centre line.** Centring the two boxes
  left it visibly high: a line box carries the font's ascent and descent, so the
  ink of a word sits below the middle of its box while a square's ink is its
  box. Measured on the rendered pixels — 10.5 px of offset at a 97.6 px font —
  and corrected in `em`, so it holds at every size the `clamp` produces.

- **A block too large for one typed array says which limit it hit.** A browser
  serves at most 2 GiB in a single `Float32Array` whatever the machine has:
  measured in Chrome on a 16 GB Mac, 2,140,000,000 bytes is served, `2**31 - 4`
  is not, and four separate 1 GB arrays live side by side. It is a limit on one
  array, not on the tab, and the refusal used to blame "this machine".

  It is now checked ahead of the memory budget and cannot be overridden by a
  confirmation, because there is nothing to override; the message names the
  largest square block that can be made (about 23,170 × 23,170 bins) and the ways
  through. The whole-genome view no longer reaches it at all — it reads pooled —
  so what it governs now is a region, a genome or a pair.

  A test asserted that yeast at 500 bp loads densely, and was passing, because it
  exercised the *estimate* and the estimate never tried to allocate anything.

- **The Annotations panel scrolls as a whole, not card by card.** Twelve little
  scrollbars where the reader wanted one. `overflow-x: auto` was set on the cards
  so a wide one could scroll sideways inside a narrow column — but a box with
  `overflow-x: auto` and `overflow-y: visible` is not a thing CSS has: the
  visible half computes to `auto`, so every card was a scroll container in both
  directions, and a flex item shrinks by default, so each one was squeezed and
  scrolled inside itself the moment the panel was full. `flex: 0 0 auto` on the
  cards is the whole fix. `.side` keeps the opposite behaviour deliberately: a
  view's sidebar fills the column so its contig list can scroll where it is.

- **Less white between a key and its value in the File card.** The key column was
  a fixed 9rem, set when values were elided and had to start at a predictable
  place. They run to their full width now, so there is nothing to line up with,
  and the column takes what its longest key needs.

- **More room before any of that.** The memory budget is now half of what the
  device claims rather than a third, and the assumed memory where the browser
  says nothing — Firefox and Safari, on every machine — is 8 GiB rather than 4.
  A 20,000-bin block, 1.9 GB, was refused outright on both of those engines and
  now loads. Guessing high costs nothing since the allocation itself is caught
  and translated; guessing low was costing pictures the machine could draw.

- **The whole-metagenome view is a view state, not a mode the shell holds.** It
  was the only landing view of a file with no link, no history entry and no back
  button — pick it and the URL did not move, so it could not be shared, and
  reloading landed on the genomes table. It is `view=overview` now, a peer of
  the two tables it shares the root menu with, and everything that follows from
  that follows: the level and the colour scale are in the hash like every other
  view's, the back button leaves it, and the plot re-measures when a side panel
  is dragged — which, being mounted outside the shell's own view slot, it did
  not.

- **The three panels resize — which, despite 0.4.0, is the first time.** The
  drag handle, the remembered width and the double-click reset all shipped, and
  none of them could be reached: the handle was a sticky flex item at the end of
  a column that was already full, so it was laid out *below* the fold, and
  `sticky` only holds an element that scrolling would carry away — it never
  pulls one up into view. The negative margin meant to cancel its height could
  not, because a percentage margin resolves against the containing block's
  width whatever axis it is on. So the strip was real, painted, and permanently
  out of sight.

  It is now positioned against the column, and the column no longer scrolls:
  its body does. The heading staying put while the cards move under it is the
  same change seen from the front.

### Changed

- **Saving a figure is one row: resolution, format, Save.** It was a DPI
  dropdown, then a line of two buttons labelled `PNG` and `PDF`, two rows
  further down — which made the choice of file into the action itself and left
  the resolution stranded above the thing it applied to. Now the row reads the
  way the sentence does: 300 dpi, PDF, Save. Both defaults are unchanged; PDF
  simply stops being the second button and becomes the one that is already
  chosen.

- **Cards in General scroll sideways rather than eliding or wrapping.** A URI
  cut off at `Hum66.met…` and a genome name broken across three lines are the
  same failure: this panel is where you go to read the identity of what is on
  screen, and an identity you cannot read whole is not one. Keys and values now
  keep to a single line and the card scrolls under them. Hovering still gives
  the full text, for the reader who would rather not.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- **A real app icon, dark, everywhere an icon appears.** The mark is the thing
  the viewer draws — a block-diagonal contact map, three genomes on the
  diagonal and two long-range contacts off it — on a macOS-style plate. It
  replaces the flat blue square with two white blocks, and it is now one
  drawing rather than two: `scripts/make-app-icons.py` renders the browser tab
  favicon, the install prompt's 192 and 512, a new `apple-touch-icon.png` for
  the iOS home screen, and the 1024 square electron-builder derives every
  macOS, Windows and Linux icon from. The favicon is written into `index.html`
  by the same script, from the same constants, so the tab icon and the dock
  icon cannot drift apart the way the two hand-kept drawings could.

  The dark variant is the one that ships at every size. The light one is still
  drawn, into an ignored `out/`, so the mark exists in both values — but
  nothing in the build reads it.

  The plate's edge is now a ring band — the difference of two squircles, filled
  with a vertical gradient — rather than a stroked outline clipped back to the
  silhouette. The old way drew the border at full strength and then threw most
  of it away in the compositing, against a mask whose own edge is antialiased,
  which is why the light plate had a border only in the sense that something
  was there. Each variant now names a `rim` and a `bevel`: the light plate gets
  a warm dark hairline with a white highlight inside it, the dark plate the
  white hairline it already had, crisper.

- **The Linux window carries the icon too.** electron-builder installs the
  launcher entry and the hicolor ladder, but the window itself is drawn from
  what the process declares, so the taskbar and the alt-tab switcher showed the
  default Electron icon. `build/icon.png` now ships beside the asar as an extra
  resource and `BrowserWindow` names it. No change on macOS or Windows, where
  the bundle and the `.exe` already answer that question.

### Removed

- `scripts/make-app-icons.mjs`, superseded by `scripts/make-app-icons.py`. It
  wrote the same three files, so leaving it would have meant one `npm run
  icons:app` away from silently reinstating the old mark. `icons:app` now runs
  the Python script and takes `METACOOLER_PYTHON` the way `fixtures` does; it
  needs `pillow` and `numpy`, and the icons it draws stay committed, so no
  clone and no CI runner has to have either.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Three named panels — General, Annotations, Aesthetics — all foldable and all
  resizable.** They had grown into three unrelated things: a sidebar with a fold
  button, a column added beside it with a fold button copied from it, and a
  controls column with no button and no name at all. They are the same object, so
  they are now one; what differs is a name, a side and a default width. Drag a
  panel's inner edge to resize it, double-click the edge to reset it, and both
  the width and the fold are remembered. <kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd> and
  <kbd>m</kbd> fold them. A card too wide for the column it is in scrolls inside
  it rather than spilling out of it.

- **The tracks pan and zoom the map.** A lane is a picture of the same window the
  map shows, drawn through the same scales, so dragging one and dragging the map
  are the same gesture on the same data — and a track you could read but not move
  was an exception a reader had to discover. Dragging a bottom lane scrolls the
  columns, dragging a right lane scrolls the rows, and a wheel over either zooms
  exactly as a wheel over the map does. The lanes carry the map's arrowhead
  cursor for the same reason.

- **An annotations panel of its own**, between the file sidebar and the map. The
  three annotation cards used to live in the file sidebar, folded in under the
  record card, and shared its scroll box: a growing list of tracks bought its
  height by pushing the file's own identity off the top of the screen, and
  folding the sidebar to get the room back took the annotations with it. They
  are now a column with its own fold (a `layers` button beside the sidebar's, or
  <kbd>a</kbd>) and its own scroll. The two left columns are ordered outward from
  the map by how often they are touched.

- **The colour and the name are edited where they are shown.** Clicking the
  swatch in a row opens the colour picker; clicking the name edits it in place.
  Both were fields behind the settings disclosure, which made the two commonest
  changes to an annotation among the most expensive. They are no longer offered
  in the settings, because they are no longer hidden.

- **Rows can be reordered**, by dragging the grip or by focusing it and pressing
  the arrow keys. The order is the order the lanes are stacked in beside the map,
  so this replaces removing three tracks and dropping them again in the order you
  wanted.

- **One hairline, and every value at once, when you point at a track.** Hovering
  a lane draws a single line — not a crosshair — across the lane stack and the
  map, at the position under the pointer, and the tooltip reads out *every* value
  track on that edge at that position rather than only the lane being pointed at.
  The lane the pointer is in is marked. A gene or peak under the pointer is
  described underneath.

- **Placing marks by clicking the map is a mode**, not a single shot. "Pick on
  map" stays on and becomes **Done**; every click places a mark until Done or
  <kbd>Esc</kbd>. Marking up a figure is eight gestures, not one, and the trip
  back to the sidebar between each was the whole cost of the feature.

- **Autoscale groups are a picker.** A group is only a group once two tracks are
  in it, so the second track has to be given the *same* name as the first — and
  the free-text box gave no way to find out what that was. A misremembered name
  raised nothing; it quietly made a group of one. The list is now the memory, and
  `new group…` is where a name is coined.

### Changed

- **The centre column stays light in the dark theme.** A contact map is a
  *figure*: its colormaps are built for ink on white, its labels and frame are
  drawn in the greys `ops/show.py` uses, and what leaves as a PNG or a PDF is
  light whatever the screen was. Letting the theme through meant the picture on
  screen was not the picture exported — and the halo behind every label, which is
  the page background, turned black behind dark grey text on a white plot.
  Everything around it — header, panels, status bar — is dark as before.

- **The lane tooltip names the position, not the lane.** The lane is the one the
  pointer is on, which the pointer already says and the marked row repeats; the
  heading is now the coordinate alone. Values read `name: number`.

- **The `auto` limit is a button**, bordered while it is on, rather than a tick
  box — and typing either bound turns it off, which is the only thing typing a
  bound can mean. The tick box was a third control on a row that already held two
  number boxes, and it took the width that made them overflow their card.

- **The annotation cards have lost their subtitles.** Each drop area under the
  heading already says what it takes and how it is drawn.

- **A new annotation is drawn on the right edge**, not the bottom. The bottom
  already carries the coordinate axis, the block labels and the colourbar
  caption, and a stack of tracks there pushes the map up the page; the space
  beside it is empty in every view. Both tick boxes still work as before.

- **Lane height is typed in pixels**, with the drawing style beside it, in place
  of a slider. A slider is for a quantity with no natural unit, and this one has
  the most natural unit there is.

- **Track limits are trimmed** the way the colour clip's boxes already were, and
  capped at three decimals. A bigWig header stores `float32`, so the faithful
  seed for a limit was `0.03999999910593033`.

- **Loop calls are ringed once**, on the upper side of the diagonal, instead of
  on both. The matrix is symmetric, so ringing both said the same thing twice —
  and on a set of any size the second ring was a few hundred circles the reader
  has to check against the diagonal to know they are not a second set. A view
  whose two axes are different blocks still shows the one placement it can.

- **A track's summary no longer counts the file's zoom levels.** That is a fact
  about how the bigWig was built rather than about what is in it, and it pushed
  the value range — the number a reader can act on — onto a second line.

### Removed

- **The per-track `linear`/`log2` scaling option.** It was a dropdown whose
  effect on a lane forty pixels tall was hard to read and easy to forget having
  set, and it put a lane on a different value axis from the one beside it, which
  is the opposite of what the autoscale group next to it is for. A ratio that
  wants a log axis is better written that way by the tool that made the bigWig,
  where the axis label can say so. A stored session that had `log2` set comes
  back linear.

### Fixed

- **The colourbar no longer disappears when tracks are shown.** Assigning
  `canvas.width` clears a canvas, and the legend's redraw was guarded on the
  colour *scale* having changed — which a resize does not change. Adding a track
  was enough to trigger it: the lanes relayout the plot, the resize observer
  fires, the bar is cleared, the guard says the scale is the same, and the legend
  is gone for as long as the view lasts. The invariant now lives inside `resize`,
  where a third caller cannot forget it.

- **A right-hand lane stack no longer overflows the column it is in.** The map's
  height budget accounted for the tracks stacked *under* it but its width
  accounted for nothing stacked *beside* it, so nine tracks on the right edge ran
  out under the view controls — where the far half of the stack was not merely
  off-screen but could not be hovered at all. Unreachable before this release
  because the bottom edge was the default; the default is now the right one.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Tracks and annotations, on cool and mcool files.** Three cards in the left
  sidebar, and everything they draw. See [SPECS §8](SPECS.md#8-tracks-and-annotations).

  **Linear annotations** takes one GTF or GFF gene model, any number of bigWig
  tracks, and any number of BED-like segment files (BED 3–12, narrowPeak,
  broadPeak). Each is drawn beside the map on the bottom edge, the right edge or
  both, with its own colour, height, style (line, area or bars), value scaling
  (linear or log2), and limits — auto, which rescales to what is on screen, or a
  pair of numbers. Tracks that share an autoscale **group** resolve to one range
  over everything they show, which is the only way two of them can be compared
  by eye.

  **Map overlays** takes BED-like files as marks on the diagonal — a box for an
  extent, a mark across the diagonal for a point call, which is the only shape
  that survives being zoomed out — and BEDPE-like files as circles off it. A
  headed table with `chrom1/start1/end1/chrom2/start2/end2` counts as BEDPE,
  because that is what loop callers actually emit.

  **Manual annotations** takes vertical, horizontal and crossed lines, and
  arrowheads on or off the diagonal. Both are entered as coordinates or placed
  by clicking the plot, and both are stored in base pairs, so they survive a
  zoom, a pan and a change of resolution in an `.mcool`.

  Nothing drawn on the map fills the pixel it is about: loops are open circles,
  domains are outlines, and the arrowhead sits *outside* the cell it points at,
  on the far side from the diagonal — mirrored below it, so a mark placed while
  reading the upper triangle never points into the map from the lower one.

  Everything stays locked to the matrix because it is drawn through the matrix's
  own coordinate scales; nothing here computes a second mapping. Panning and
  zooming perform **no I/O**, as they already did for the map: a track fetches a
  window half again as wide as the view at a resolution rounded to a power of
  two, and everything inside that redraws from memory. Zooming out averages
  through bigWig's own zoom levels, and a feature lane with more features than
  pixels switches to a density profile rather than painting a solid bar. Hovering
  a lane names the feature or reads out the value; the crosshair continues from
  the map into every lane; exported PNGs and PDFs carry the lanes, redrawn at
  the export resolution.

  Contig names are checked on load and the overlap is always reported, in both
  directions — a GTF using `chrI` against a map using `I` is the most likely
  support question there is, and it presents as a broken feature rather than as
  two files disagreeing.

  Restricted to cool and mcool. On a `.metacool` the cards are **absent**, not
  disabled: a metagenome's axis is contigs from thousands of independently
  assembled organisms, so a file keyed on contig names either coincides with it
  or misleads.

- **One click loads the ten tracks published beside the yeast micro-C map.**
  Gene models, MNase, ATAC, Pol II ChIP-over-input, stranded RNA-seq, shotgun
  coverage, two peak sets and the loop calls — all on that map's own assembly.
  Offered only when the map itself came from a URL, never for a local file that
  happens to share the name.

- **The tooltip says how far apart a contact is.** Hover an off-diagonal cell
  within one chromosome or contig and it now reports the genomic distance
  between its two ends, which is the number a Hi-C map is actually read by. It
  is deliberately absent where there is no answer rather than shown as a large
  one: a trans cell has no distance along a sequence, and on the diagonal it is
  zero.
- **The tooltip names the genome, in the whole-genome view of a metacool.**
  It led with the contig, which on a metagenome is the finer half of the answer
  and rarely the one you want first. The genome now leads and the contig sits
  under it; a cell between two genomes names both. The picture underneath is
  unchanged — the separators are still the contigs.

- **A fifth example: a yeast micro-C map at one resolution.**
  `Yeast_microC_G2M_1kb.cool` — 16 chromosomes of synthetic yeast, 1 kb bins,
  179 M contacts, balanced. It is the first single-resolution cooler in the
  picker, so it is also the choice that lands somewhere with no resolution
  ladder to pick from.
- **Ten track resources published beside it**: MNase, ATAC, Pol II
  ChIP-over-input and stranded RNA-seq coverage, shotgun coverage, ATAC and Pol
  II peak calls, gene models, and the loop calls made on that map. They are not
  in the picker; the annotation cards above are what reads them. All ten are on
  the map's own assembly rather than on R64 — same 16 contig names, same
  lengths, no coordinate off the end of a chromosome — which is the property to
  check before republishing any of them. See
  [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md#the-track-resources).

- **Works offline, and installs.** After one visit the app runs with no network at all — reload
  included — and browsers offer to install it as a standalone window. The app is cached; the data
  never is, and requests for it reach the network untouched. A new build is offered as a reload
  rather than swapped in underneath you.

- **A desktop application, for machines that cannot reach the website.** The same
  bundle packaged with Electron: a `.dmg` and a `.zip` for macOS (Apple Silicon and
  Intel), an NSIS installer for Windows, an AppImage and a `.deb` for Linux. It is a
  delivery channel and not a second feature set — it opens exactly the files the web
  build opens, in exactly the same way, with the same reader and the same privacy
  claim, and it never writes anything back. There is no auto-update: a new version is
  a new download. The first releases are **unsigned**, so macOS and Windows will each
  warn once before running it; [docs/desktop.md](docs/desktop.md) gives both warnings
  verbatim with the exact click that gets past them. The web app is unchanged — same
  URL, same build, nothing to install.

  It has a native menu, and one capability the web app cannot have: it asks
  remote hosts not to compress. `Accept-Encoding` is a forbidden header name in
  a page, so a `.metacool` served with `Content-Encoding: gzip` — which is what
  GitHub Pages does — is refused by the website with no way around it. The
  desktop build sets the header from outside the page, so the same file on the
  same host opens.

- **The footer states the privacy claim, which it had been promising to.** The
  dismissable notice on the picker says the footer keeps the same statement, and
  `StatusBar` asserted it in its own documentation, but nothing rendered it — so
  dismissing the notice removed the claim from the app. The statement is also
  reworded, in both targets, from "leaves your browser" to "leaves this machine":
  the first is false in a window that is not a browser, and the second is true in
  both.

### Changed

- **A selection opens a region instead of zooming.** Option-drag draws a square —
  it always resolved to one, so drawing a rectangle promised something it would
  not give — and releasing it opens what the square covers: the chromosome or
  contig the drag began in, ending at the edge of the box or of the sequence,
  whichever comes first. On the whole-metagenome view, where no smaller region
  exists, it opens the genome. Zoom is still the wheel, the keys and pinch.
- **Two fingers sideways go back and forward** over the heatmap, as they already
  did everywhere else on the page.
- **A selection in the trans corner opens the intersection**, not one of the two
  sequences: the rectangle between two chromosomes, or the genome pair. On the
  diagonal it is still one region.
- **Switching resolution in an `.mcool` keeps the view** you were in — the same
  genome, contig and range at the new bin size — instead of returning to the
  landing table. The colour clip is not carried, because it is in counts and
  counts scale with the bin.
- **A pooled picture says so.** Above 4,096 bins on an axis the raster is pooled,
  one pixel per block of bins carrying the strongest value under it; the summary
  now reads "drawn 4 × 4 bins to a pixel" and explains why the crosshair reports
  several coordinates inside one square, and why zooming does not sharpen it.

### Fixed

- `w` opens the whole-genome view again. The repaint short-circuit could not tell "nothing changed"
  from "show me the other picture of the same thing", and swallowed it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-03

The first numbered release: everything below was built under `0.1.0`, which was never cut.

### Added

- **Opening files.** Drag and drop a local `.metacool`, `.mmetacool`, `.cool` or `.mcool` — read in
  place through the Emscripten filesystem, never uploaded — or a URL, read over HTTP range requests.
  The published demo datasets are offered as examples. A collection opens at one of its entries and
  offers the rest; an `.mcool` resolution ladder is a dropdown in the breadcrumb.
- **Tables.** A sortable, filterable genomes table as the landing view, with every metadata column
  the file carries and the free `bin1_offset` density proxy; the same for contigs. Filters, search
  and sort are remembered per file and per table.
- **Views.** One genome; the rectangular block between two genomes; a region, or the rectangle
  between two contigs; a cooler's whole genome; and the gated whole-metagenome overview, computed by
  one pass over every pixel or read from a sidecar edge list.
- **The heatmap.** Pan, drag-to-zoom on a modifier, wheel zoom, touch gestures, keyboard pan and
  zoom, a crosshair, a hover tooltip and a coordinate readout. `metacooler show`'s colour rule
  (`log1p`, 99th percentile) with typed clip bounds, a colormap picker including colour-vision-safe
  ramps, and balanced counts where the file carries weights.
- **Axis furniture.** Block names in the gutters, boundary ticks outside the plot, base-pair ticks on
  an axis with a single coordinate system, and dividers over the data. Each toggles independently.
- **Export.** PNG and PDF at 96–600 dpi, re-rendered rather than screen-grabbed, captioned with the
  file, genome, framed range, bin size, scale and time, and named with a timestamp.
- **The shell.** A file-info sidebar with a card for the row behind the current heatmap, a command
  palette, a keyboard-shortcut dialog, a light/dark/system theme, a status bar reporting bytes read,
  and an opt-in deep validation of the open file.
- **Deployment.** A static bundle published to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`, with the base
  path resolved at build time.

### Changed

- The whole-metagenome overview opens at contig level, marks genome blocks, and answers a click with
  the genome or the genome pair rather than a single contig.
- Axis labels appear as soon as fewer than fifty blocks are *in view*, so zooming brings out the
  names of a 20,000-contig map; contigs over 50 kb are labelled whatever the count. Clicking a label
  opens what it names.
- The view's controls are a column of the shell, scrolling on their own beside the plot.
- Reading, rendering and sorting were reworked for large files: a windowed pixel read, a pooled
  raster, memoised bin→unit maps, and sorting once per column rather than once per keystroke.

### Fixed

- A region no longer reaches into the next chromosome on a file whose bin table is not
  `binnify(chromsizes, binsize)` — five yeast chromosomes at 2 kb, where the extra bin also cost the
  view its base-pair ticks.
- A press no longer scrolls the canvas out from under the pointer, which made clicks near a genome
  boundary open the neighbour.
- Toggling labels no longer crops a fitted view.

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

The version the package carried while the viewer was being built. Never tagged and never deployed
under that name; its history is in the commit log.
