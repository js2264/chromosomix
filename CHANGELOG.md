# Changelog

Notable changes to the viewer, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) — for an application that means the **format and URL
contract** rather than a code API: a major bump is a `.metacool` the previous version could open and
this one cannot, or a `#`-hash link that no longer resolves to the same view.

The deployed site at <https://js2264.github.io/metacooler.js/> is built from `main` on every push, so
it can be ahead of the newest entry here. Its exact build is in **About → version**, and in the
`/Producer` field of any PDF it exports.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Works offline, and installs.** After one visit the app runs with no network at all — reload
  included — and browsers offer to install it as a desktop app. The app is cached; the data never
  is, and requests for it reach the network untouched. A new build is offered as a reload rather
  than swapped in underneath you.

### Changed

- **A selection opens a region instead of zooming.** Option-drag draws a square —
  it always resolved to one, so drawing a rectangle promised something it would
  not give — and releasing it opens what the square covers: the chromosome or
  contig the drag began in, ending at the edge of the box or of the sequence,
  whichever comes first. On the whole-metagenome view, where no smaller region
  exists, it opens the genome. Zoom is still the wheel, the keys and pinch.
- **Two fingers sideways go back and forward** over the heatmap, as they already
  did everywhere else on the page.
- **A selection in the trans corner opens the intersection**, not one of the two
  sequences: the rectangle between two chromosomes, or the genome pair. On the
  diagonal it is still one region.
- **Switching resolution in an `.mcool` keeps the view** you were in — the same
  genome, contig and range at the new bin size — instead of returning to the
  landing table. The colour clip is not carried, because it is in counts and
  counts scale with the bin.
- **A pooled picture says so.** Above 4,096 bins on an axis the raster is pooled,
  one pixel per block of bins carrying the strongest value under it; the summary
  now reads "drawn 4 × 4 bins to a pixel" and explains why the crosshair reports
  several coordinates inside one square, and why zooming does not sharpen it.

### Fixed

- `w` opens the whole-genome view again. The repaint short-circuit could not tell "nothing changed"
  from "show me the other picture of the same thing", and swallowed it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-03

The first numbered release: everything below was built under `0.1.0`, which was never cut.

### Added

- **Opening files.** Drag and drop a local `.metacool`, `.mmetacool`, `.cool` or `.mcool` — read in
  place through the Emscripten filesystem, never uploaded — or a URL, read over HTTP range requests.
  The published demo datasets are offered as examples. A collection opens at one of its entries and
  offers the rest; an `.mcool` resolution ladder is a dropdown in the breadcrumb.
- **Tables.** A sortable, filterable genomes table as the landing view, with every metadata column
  the file carries and the free `bin1_offset` density proxy; the same for contigs. Filters, search
  and sort are remembered per file and per table.
- **Views.** One genome; the rectangular block between two genomes; a region, or the rectangle
  between two contigs; a cooler's whole genome; and the gated whole-metagenome overview, computed by
  one pass over every pixel or read from a sidecar edge list.
- **The heatmap.** Pan, drag-to-zoom on a modifier, wheel zoom, touch gestures, keyboard pan and
  zoom, a crosshair, a hover tooltip and a coordinate readout. `metacooler show`'s colour rule
  (`log1p`, 99th percentile) with typed clip bounds, a colormap picker including colour-vision-safe
  ramps, and balanced counts where the file carries weights.
- **Axis furniture.** Block names in the gutters, boundary ticks outside the plot, base-pair ticks on
  an axis with a single coordinate system, and dividers over the data. Each toggles independently.
- **Export.** PNG and PDF at 96–600 dpi, re-rendered rather than screen-grabbed, captioned with the
  file, genome, framed range, bin size, scale and time, and named with a timestamp.
- **The shell.** A file-info sidebar with a card for the row behind the current heatmap, a command
  palette, a keyboard-shortcut dialog, a light/dark/system theme, a status bar reporting bytes read,
  and an opt-in deep validation of the open file.
- **Deployment.** A static bundle published to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`, with the base
  path resolved at build time.

### Changed

- The whole-metagenome overview opens at contig level, marks genome blocks, and answers a click with
  the genome or the genome pair rather than a single contig.
- Axis labels appear as soon as fewer than fifty blocks are *in view*, so zooming brings out the
  names of a 20,000-contig map; contigs over 50 kb are labelled whatever the count. Clicking a label
  opens what it names.
- The view's controls are a column of the shell, scrolling on their own beside the plot.
- Reading, rendering and sorting were reworked for large files: a windowed pixel read, a pooled
  raster, memoised bin→unit maps, and sorting once per column rather than once per keystroke.

### Fixed

- A region no longer reaches into the next chromosome on a file whose bin table is not
  `binnify(chromsizes, binsize)` — five yeast chromosomes at 2 kb, where the extra bin also cost the
  view its base-pair ticks.
- A press no longer scrolls the canvas out from under the pointer, which made clicks near a genome
  boundary open the neighbour.
- Toggling labels no longer crops a fitted view.

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

The version the package carried while the viewer was being built. Never tagged and never deployed
under that name; its history is in the commit log.
